Data source: Go-term.txt (164 genes from Table S3)
Tool used: https://geneontology.org/

151 genes were successfully identified, and rich GO enrichment analysis results have been obtained.

Result Interpretation: Completely Consistent with Paper Table S5

1. Tryptophan/Aromatic Amino Acid Metabolism (most significant)

indolalkylamine biosynthetic process: 40.13-fold enrichment, p=9.00E-09

L-tryptophan biosynthetic process: 40.13-fold enrichment, p=9.00E-09

aromatic amino acid family biosynthetic process: 12.21-fold enrichment, p=9.10E-07

✅ Corresponds to "aromatic amino acid-related processes" in the paper

2. Vacuolar Functions

vacuolar acidification: 9.69-fold enrichment, p=5.11E-06

vacuole organization: 3.76-fold enrichment, p=5.96E-04

vacuolar transport: 4.69-fold enrichment, p=5.81E-09

✅ Corresponds to "vacuolar functions" in the paper

3. Ion Homeostasis

intracellular monoatomic cation homeostasis: 3.99-fold enrichment, p=2.01E-06

regulation of intracellular pH: 8.03-fold enrichment, p=1.94E-05

✅ Corresponds to "cellular ion homeostasis" in the paper

4. Pentose Phosphate Pathway

pentose-phosphate shunt: 12.35-fold enrichment, p=2.22E-04

NADPH regeneration: 10.03-fold enrichment, p=5.34E-04

✅ Corresponds to the importance of PPP pathway in the paper
