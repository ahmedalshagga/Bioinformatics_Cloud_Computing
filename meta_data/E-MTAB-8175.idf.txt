Experiment Description	To elucidate underlying mechanisms responsible for enhanced isobutanol tolerance of the gln3 deletion strain, we performed RNA-seq experiments in biological duplicate to compare the transcriptomic profiles of wild type and gln3 deletion strains grown in SC medium with or without 1.3% (v/v) isobutanol.

Protocol Description	Wild-type BY4741 and BY4741 with gln3 deletion strains were pre-cultivated in liquid SC medium at 30°C for 24 h. Each pre-culture was inoculated into fresh liquid SC medium made inhouse with or without 1.3% (v/v) isobutanol to obtain a starting OD600 of 0.1. Cultivation was performed in test tubes with screw caps at 30°C for 12 h with 240 rpm shaking.	Transcript quantification, reported as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped) from RNA-seq data, was performed by Cufflinks (version 2.2.1). To improve the robustness of the estimation of differential expression, the reads mapping to rRNA, tRNA, and non-coding RNA were excluded from the quantification. Cuffdiff (version 2.2.1) was used to normalize the data sets and calculate the fold changes and their statistical significance of two independent biological replicates. To avoid infinite fold changes, a value of one was added to all the FPKM values.	Cells were harvested at 3,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature.	Prepared cDNA libraries were sequenced on Illumina Miseq (75 bp nucleotide paired-end sequence).	The RNA-seq reads were mapped to the S. cerevisiae S288C genome sequence (version R64-1-1, Saccharomyces Genome Database) using TopHat (version 2.0.9). PicardTools (version 1.105, https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) were used to sort the mapped reads and remove PCR duplicates.	Total RNA was extracted from each culture with Isogen-LS (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan). RNA integrity was evaluated for quality control with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2,100 using Agilent RNA 6,000 Nano Kit (Agilent technologies, Santa Clara, CA).	cDNA library preparation was performed using KAPA RNA HyperPrep Kit Illumina Platforms (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA). Prepared cDNA libraries were validated with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2,100 using an Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent Technologies).
